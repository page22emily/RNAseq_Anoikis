#Details: 
### This is to do a GSEA analysis using ONLY the MsigDB Hallmark pathways 
### This is not done with clusterprofiler that I could find 
### Clusterprofiler uses the Biological processes, molecular funtion, and cellular component options 
### Generally speaking, what we want appears to be more niche than the base GSEA options 
### So the next option is to find something that incorporates the MsigDB hallmark option 
#### What I have found is the CRAN package msigdbr and I am going to attempt that and see what happens 
#### I have checked for incorporation of msigdbr and clusterprofiler, and there is a sketchy documented way to do it 

##CRAN Project Vignette: 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/msigdbr/vignettes/msigdbr-intro.html

## Options for this analysis (more in depth)
https://yulab-smu.top/biomedical-knowledge-mining-book/semantic-similarity-overview.html 

Perks of the package: 
There are all of them msigdb options present (that I know of) AND multiple species
It is ridiculously basic 
Formats make the tibble function easy to use without extra data wrangling 

Set up (from the Vignette)
```{r echo=FALSE, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}
library(clusterProfiler)
library(enrichplot)
# we use ggplot2 to add x axis labels (ex: ridgeplot)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
# SET THE DESIRED ORGANISM HERE
organism = "org.Hs.eg.db"
#BiocManager::install(organism, character.only = TRUE)
library(organism, character.only = TRUE)
```


#this is from the first go round
```{r echo=FALSE, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}
# reading in data from deseq2
df = read.csv("~/Downloads/results/all/comparisons/group_P7_3D_vs_P0_2D_Wald.csv", header=TRUE)
# we want the log2 fold change 
original_gene_list <- df$log2FoldChange

#list needs no decimal points
no_decimals <- gsub('\\.[0-9]*$','', df$x)
#now we are going to add this to the df 
df$no_decimals <- no_decimals
# name the vector
names(original_gene_list) <- df$no_decimals

# omit any NA values
gene_list<-na.omit(original_gene_list)

# sort the list in decreasing order (required for clusterProfiler)
gene_list = sort(gene_list, decreasing = TRUE)
gene.list <- data.frame(gene_list)
```


```{r}
gse <- gseGO(gene_list, ont ="ALL", keyType = "ENSEMBL", minGSSize = 15,

Adjusting for Min, Max, and Permutations to be the same as GSEA software 
Min Size: 15, Max Size 500, Permutations 1000 and no p adj method

I got a warning about the p values being inflated/ not calculated correctly because there were not enough permutations. 
There were 12 pathways this happened for, and pval, padj, NES, and log2err are set to NA. I do not like how this could skew the data. 
So in this set I am increasing it to 10k
